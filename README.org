* Emacs org-mode demo
This is one of the resons I love Emacs. The power of it as an editor is outstanding. It provides a complete development environment for me. With it, I'm able to keep my source code and my documentation in the same file. I can extract the source code and generate the documentation using executable code blocks. If I need to insert links or images into my documentation I can. 

* What was generated
The only files that I created were the org files. The markdown file, html file and python file were all created by Emacs.
